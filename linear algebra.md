# Linear Algebra

# **Linear Algebra**

This is an archive of the first 5 weeks of the linear algebra course I taught at Emory University in Spring 2021. I cross-posted all announcements and notes both here and on the Canvas page, but students much preferred Canvas and it got overwhelming to keep two websites up to date so I gave up posting here after the first half of the semester. I hope the incomplete information presented here is still somewhat helpful.

Please scroll all the way down for general information about the course, or [click here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fsflt9urq8k0gwym%2FMaryamKhaqan-LinearAlgebraSyllabus-Jan23.pdf%3Fdl%3D0&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF9z-1PxJDFxKU3y9ygSeZFo_7aqw) for a PDF file with the course syllabus and policies.

## **Week 5 Day 3**

Exam 1 will be held in class on Friday at our usual time. It covers sections 1.1-1.3 and 2.1-2.5.

## **Week 5 Day 2**

Please submit by Friday, February 5th at 1 PM EST, over on Gradescope.

## **Week 1 Day 1:**

In this class session, we will go over the syllabus, expectations for attending an in-person class during a pandemic, and **Section 1.1** of our textbook.

### **Before you come to class:**

- Please carefully read over the syllabus file, make note of any questions you have, and come prepared to ask those questions in class.
- At some point during Week 1, please complete the survey titled: [Introductions!](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcanvas.emory.edu%2Fcourses%2F83044%2Fquizzes%2F110626&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEil_IvP1hPDHiTmNL8CNh1KCuJoA) During class, I will ask you to tell us about yourself in a few sentences. Filling out the survey might help with coming up with an introduction beforehand :)
- Here is a famous problem that uses linear algebra for you to think about if you are interested:
    - (The Hundred Fowls Problem.) One hen is worth 5 qian, one rooster 3 qian, and 3 chicks are worth 1 qian. If we bought 100 fowls with 100 qian, how many hens, roosters, and chicks did we buy?

Important note: Please don't feel discouraged if you cannot immediately solve the above problem. I haven't taught you anything yet! This is meant to give you a flavor of the kinds of things we will be talking about on Day 1.
