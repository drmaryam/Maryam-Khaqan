TO DOs for Tim :) 

- Add my buttons back! (At the top of each page there should be a way to click "Home" and go back to the front page, etc)
- Add coloumns? So in https://www.maryamkhaqan.com/teaching the content is in 3 columns instead of just a list. Similarly I would like my homepage photo to take up 2/3 of the width and not the whole width
- I LITERALLY HATE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE THEME OPTIONS Can we make this look like my OG google site please? :(
