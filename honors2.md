The Marshall Hall, Jr., Award is given annually to a doctoral student in the Department of Mathematics at Emory University as a recognition of their teaching. Candidates must have taught for at least two years and, in addition, have strong academic records with promise for excellence in mathematical research. The award was established by the noted algebraist and combinatorialist, and by his friends and family. The Graduate Committee of the Department of Mathematics selects the recipient based upon information received from the entire Department faculty.

The Graduate Student Research Award is awarded annually to students working towards degrees in Mathematics as a recognition of their research. This award is given to student(s) nominated by faculty and selected by a group of faculty members designated by the Graduate Committee.

Unlike the Marshall Hall, the GSRA can be given to multiple students in one year. In Fall 2021, I was one of two recipients.

In **Summer 2020,** I was a recipient of the **[Emory College Online Teaching Services (ECOTS) Fellowship.](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcollege.emory.edu%2Foisp%2Fremoteteaching%2Fecots%2Findex.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFWAsumxFIdapbsactedBUTkvXaQQ)**

Responsibilities for this position included guiding a faculty cohort (of 36 fall course instructors) through a three-week training that covered the essentials of online course design, digital pedagogy, and the Emory College Online model.

In Fall 2019 - Spring 2020, I was a recipient of the [Emory Advanced Graduate Teaching Fellowship.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.emory.edu%2Fstories%2F2019%2F02%2Fupress_aau_stem_grant%2Fcampus.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEbUX0cCT5EeJyYAtLlbF_-lgNLMQ)

As a part of this fellowship, I worked on a Teaching-As-Research Project measuring the role of curiosity in student engagement and performance. I was selected to present a poster at the *[CIRTL In-Person Network Meeting](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fwisc.edu%2Fcirtlspring2020%2Flogistics%3Fauthuser%3D0&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEvCgts0eDjJfwqgI53EuOPo4Adog)* that was supposed to be held at Georgia Tech in March 2020 but was canceled due to Covid-19*.*

Instead, I presented my work on the TAR project in the Advanced Graduate Teaching Fellowship Symposium held on Tuesday, May 5th, 2020, virtually via Zoom.

In Fall 2019, as a part of the [Emory Advanced Graduate Teaching Fellowship.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.emory.edu%2Fstories%2F2019%2F02%2Fupress_aau_stem_grant%2Fcampus.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEbUX0cCT5EeJyYAtLlbF_-lgNLMQ) I completed the Center for the Integration of Research Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) Network's Online Course *An Introduction to Evidence-Based Undergraduate STEM Teaching* with distinction.

A course description and a copy of the certificate can be found below:

“An Introduction to Evidence-Based Undergraduate STEM Teaching” is an open, online course designed to provide future STEM faculty, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows with an introduction to effective teaching strategies and the research that supports them. The goal of the eight-week course is to equip the next generation of STEM faculty to be effective teachers, thus improving the learning experience for the thousands of students they will teach.
